# Serverless URL shortener

üöÄ Serverless URL Shortener using a stack of AWS services, Terraform, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

üåê In today's digital age, convenience is key, and URL shorteners play a vital role in simplifying the sharing of links, enhancing user experience, and providing valuable data and branding opportunities.

üí° **Why manage your own URL shortener?** While there are many options out there, taking control of your own solution can provide numerous benefits, including full control over its functionality and appearance, in-depth analytics like link clicks and user engagement, enhanced privacy and minimizing the risk of service disruptions or changes caused by third party providers.

üìå **Technology Stack:** Utilized AWS services like Route 53, ACM, CloudFront, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB to create a robust, serverless infrastructure.

üõ†Ô∏è **Terraform Provisioning:** Orchestrated the entire setup using Terraform with an S3 backend, ensuring Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, seamless state management, and easy scalability.

üîÑ **CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** Automated deployments and updates with a seamless CI/CD workflow, making the development process efficient and reliable.

üìö **Comprehensive Documentation:** Every aspect of this project is meticulously documented in my GitHub repository. Thanks to GitHub Actions and terraform-docs, documentation is automatically generated, making it easier for anyone to understand, replicate, and extend this setup.

## Solution Architecture

![solution_architecture](img/solution_architecture.png)

### Solution Flow

1. The users access the URL shortener by using a custom domain thanks to Route 53 DNS routing service.
2. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) handles the SSL/TLS certificate and Route 53 directs the users to the CloudFront distribution. 
3. The CloudFront distribution serves an S3 static website, providing a user-friendly interface for the URL shortener.
4. When users add or delete URL pairs, the S3 static website communicates with an API Gateway endpoint to send the request and display the feedback.
5. The API Gateway triggers the corresponding Lambda function that performs the requested action and provide feedback.
6. The Lambda functions will create or delete records in DynamoDB and respond with success or failure feedback.
7. When users use the URL shortener to redirect, a Lambda@Edge function is executed.
8. The Lambda@Edge triggers a function that retrieves the full URL from DynamoDB based on the provided keyword.
9. The user's browser is redirected to the desired web page URL, completing the redirection process. It will also be redirected to an Error site in case the web page URL is not found on the DB.

### terraform-docs

``terraform-docs`` is a utility for automatically generating documentation from your Terraform modules in various output formats.

It can be triggered by an automated workflow using GitHub Actions to ensure that your documentation is always up to date. You can find the workflow configuration in **[.github/workflows/documentation.yml](.github/workflows/documentation.yml)**.

The generated documentation is available in the **[terraform/README.md](terraform/README.md)** file.

For more detailed information on terraform-docs and its capabilities, please visit the official website at [terraform-docs.io](https://terraform-docs.io/).

## Provisioning and Deployment

### Prerequisites

**1. Install Terraform**

* Visit the official Terraform website to download the latest version for your operating system: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads
* Verify the installation by running ``terraform --version`` in your terminal or command prompt. You should see the installed version displayed.

**2. Create an AWS account and ACCESS KEYS**

* Visit https://aws.amazon.com/
* Click on the "Create an AWS Account" button and follow the registration process. You will need to provide your personal information and payment details.
* After your AWS account is set up, sign in to the AWS Management Console.
* In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the "IAM (Identity and Access Management)" service.
* Create an IAM user for programmatic access by following these steps:
  * Click on "Users" in the left sidebar.
  * Click on the "Add user" button.
  * Enter a username and select "Programmatic access" as the access type.
  * Set permissions for the user according to your requirements. For basic Terraform usage, you might want to attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy to the user for simplicity. However, it's recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and grant only the necessary permissions for your specific use case.
  * Access the user, go to Security credentials and create an access key for a third-party service. Note down the ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY when they are displayed. These keys are required for AWS CLI and Terraform operations.

If you are using Linux OS, make sure these ACCESS KEYS are loaded in the following file:

````bash
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
````


**3. Add GitHub Actions secrets and variables for the Terraform**

This solution contemplates the use of input variables that Terraform will use for the configuration.

As the deployment process is automated by GitHub Actions, it's required that you create the following GitHub repository **secrets** and **variables**:

| Secrets                        | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID              | ACCESS_KEY_ID created on step 2.                                                            |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY          | SECRET_ACCESS_KEY created on step 2.                                                        |

| Variables               | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DOMAIN_NAME             | Domain name for the Hosted Zone created by Route 53.                                        |
| SUBDOMAIN               | Subdomain of the Hosted Zone that will point to the CloudFront domain.                      |
| BUCKET                  | The name of the S3 bucket where the HTML files will be stored. Should be unique across AWS. |
| REGION                  | Region where AWS will provision the resources.                                              |
| TF_STATE_BACKEND_BUCKET | The name of the S3 bucket where the Terraform state files will be stored.                   |
| TF_STATE_BACKEND_KEY    | The key (object key) in the S3 bucket where the Terraform state file is stored.             |
| TF_STATE_LOCK           | DynamoDB table to use for state locking.                                                    |

**4. Get access to manage the domain registrar DNS nameservers**

This solution is using AWS Certificate Manager alongside Route 53 in order to be exposed using a custom domain.

However, before the Amazon certificate authority (CA) can issue a certificate for your site, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) must prove that you own or control all of the domain names that you specify in your request.

This solution contemplates that AWS Route 53 will handle all DNS requests for your domain, and you manage your DNS records within Route 53.

In the scenario that you own a domain from any registrar other than Route 53 (e.g. GoDaddy, Hostinger, etc.), a prerequisite is that you have access to update the DNS Nameserver for the domain.

**Example:**

![prerequisite_domain_registrar](img/prerequisite_domain_registrar.png)

Once Terraform has created the Route 53 hosted zoned, it would be necessary to manually update above DNS Nameservers in the domain registrar.

**5. Provision the S3 backend resources**

After the previous steps are done, and before we can continue with the provisioning of the solution, it's required to set up the resources required for the S3 backend to store the Terraform state file and state lock information. 

These are an S3 bucket, key (file path within the bucket), AWS region, encryption settings, and a DynamoDB table for state locking to provide safe and concurrent access to the Terraform state.

````bash
/serverless-url-shortener $ cd s3-remote-backend/terraform
/serverless-url-shortener/s3-remote-backend/terraform $ cat <<EOF > terraform.tfvars
tf_state_backend_bucket = "<same value as used for TF_STATE_BACKEND_BUCKET in step 3>"
tf_state_lock = "<same value as used for TF_STATE_LOCK in step 3>"
EOF
/serverless-url-shortener/s3-remote-backend/terraform $ terraform init
/serverless-url-shortener/s3-remote-backend/terraform $ terraform apply -auto-approve
````

With these resources provisioned, we are good to continue.

**6. Update GitHub Actions workflow permissions**

In order to allow terraform-docs workflow to create documentation you will need to provide Write access.

Turns out that, in new repositories, workflows only have the Read permission. You need to enable the Read and write permissions in the repository settings.

Go to Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions and choose Read and write permissions.

![workflow_permissions](img/workflow_permissions.png)

### Run

**1. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflows**

In order to trigger GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow you only need to create a commit and push it to the GitHub repository

**2. Manually update DNS Nameservers in the domain registrar:**

Once the GitHub Action workflows log shows that the Hosted Zone has been created, the next step is to access to it from the AWS Console and update the Domain Registrar Nameservers:

    aws_route53_zone.hosted_zone: Creation complete after 35s [id=Z04841651NZPBRIVGO677]

![prerequisite_1_create_route53_hosted_zone](img/route53_hosted_zone_nameservers.png)

![prerequisite_2_update_domain_registrar_nameservers](img/update_domain_registrar_nameservers.png)

During the ``terraform apply`` execution, the ACM certificate validation will be waiting until the DNS records are updated. 

Even though DNS propagation can take up to 24-48 hours, in my experience this process usually takes around 30 minutes:

    aws_acm_certificate_validation.acm_certificate_validation: Still creating... [50s elapsed]
    aws_acm_certificate_validation.acm_certificate_validation: Still creating... [1m0s elapsed]
    aws_acm_certificate_validation.acm_certificate_validation: Still creating... [1m10s elapsed]
    ...
    ...
    aws_acm_certificate_validation.acm_certificate_validation: Still creating... [34m0s elapsed]
    aws_acm_certificate_validation.acm_certificate_validation: Still creating... [34m10s elapsed]
    aws_acm_certificate_validation.acm_certificate_validation: Creation complete after 34m20s [id=0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC]

**3. Access the solution URL**

Go to the GitHub Actions workflow logs and at the end of the "Deploy with Terraform" step you should see the solution URL:

    Apply complete! Resources: 36 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    
    Outputs:
    
    serverless-url-shortener = "https://serverless-url-shortener.lucaslivrone.tech"


### Destroy

In order to destroy the resources created by the ``terraform-deployment.yml`` workflow you can replace the last step action in the file with the following code, commit and push the changes to re-trigger the workflow:
````yaml
      - name: Destroy with Terraform
        run: |
          cd terraform
          terraform init \
          -backend-config="bucket=${{ vars.TF_STATE_BACKEND_BUCKET }}" \
          -backend-config="key=${{ vars.TF_STATE_BACKEND_KEY }}" \
          -backend-config="region=${{ vars.REGION }}" \
          -backend-config="dynamodb_table=${{ vars.TF_STATE_LOCK }}" \
          -backend-config="encrypt=true"
          terraform destroy -auto-approve
````
